About:

This work, in particular, evaluates the performance of various DCNN architectures, including VGG16, Resnet50, MobileNet, InceptionResNetV2 for classification of chest X-ray images from covid-19-positive, pneumonia and normal healthy individuals in 3-classes vs 2-classes classification schemes.

Run:

Please run code as this order:

1- Run MakingDataset.ipynb for download and make dataset, then you must create two folder as data and data1. In data1 create two folders as train and test, in which each of them create three new folder and rename these to:normal,covid and pneumonia.

2- For ResNet101 model run ResNet10.ipynb for making model and predict on test data.

3- For our prposed Network, run COVID-19_SmallNet.ipynb for making model and predict on test data.

you can download it and run CPVID-SmallerNet.ipynb or ResNet10.ipynb for training.
